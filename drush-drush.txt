You're the one to build my local, please 
dl, site-install, it's such a breeze
What I'm saying is my prompt's for you

Core-status, make Drupal's version show
You run make-generate
And watch the makefile grow

I'm gonna run utilities
I'm gonna run my cron hooks through you
List my queues, run my queues,
Oh baby baby please!

Drush, drush, hurry hurry updates come to me
Drush, drush, I wanna clear cache, 
I wanna clear cache easily
Drush, drush, gonna omit .git directory
Drush, drush, ooh, archive-dump my tree
